            <p>Hi! I'm Rati, an experimental filmmaker, animator, and illustration artist. I dive into all things quirky and creative, bringing ideas to life in ways that surprise and inspire!</p>
            <p>My work revolves around the weird, the imperfect, and the beautifully bizarre. I find joy in storytelling, whether through frame-by-frame animation, sketchbooks, or vivid paintings.</p>
            <p>Animals, emotions, and the unseen magic of life fuel my creativity. My dream? To tell stories that make you feel something real.</p>
